This application allows you to enter the URL of an article and generates a summary of the most important information in 5 bullet points. It is a useful tool for people who want to quickly grasp the key points of an article without having to read the entire thing. It can also be used to send email notifications with the summary every time a new article is posted. A graphical user interface (GUI) needs to be developed for this application to make it more user-friendly.
